# Recursive Candies in Java
I find recursion really exciting, so I wrote this program to implement it. It also helped me to understand how math is handled in Java a little better.
The premise is that it helps the user to find out how many candies they can get for their money. The important part being that for every 3 candies they eat they can trade the wrapper for 1 more.

# Development Enviroment
The easiest way to set up the envirment was to use a Java Repl.it.
Repl.it is an incredibly user friendly enviroment although lacking in features. it is only suitable for small projects

# Build and run
To build and execute this program you can visit this link https://repl.it/@BradenHansen/javaMadlib.

Screenshots of the sofware are included in the repository.

I found that w3 schools website was incredibly direct in giving me the answers to my syntax questions.
